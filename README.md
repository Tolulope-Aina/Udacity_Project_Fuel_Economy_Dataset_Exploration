# Fuel Economy Data Exploration
## by Aina Tolulope


## Dataset

This dataset contains information about 4,000 cars, their manufacturing year, vehicle class, fuel type, fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions, fuel economy score, greenhouse gas score amoung others.


## Summary of Findings

In this exploration, I found  that there's a negative correlation between combined fuel efficiency and displacement and a positive correlation between CO2 emmisions and displacement, shown by the respective correlation coefficient of both relationships.
There's a strong inverse relationship between combined fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions, with a very high negative correlation coefficient of -0.929. These 3 variables and thus the relationships between them, are modified to varying degrees by the other variables of interest explored in this dataset
There's a positive correlation between the number of cylinders in a car engine and the amount of displacement it can archieve, with more cylinders producing greater displacement and because of the positive correlation between displacement and CO2 emissions, greater CO2 emissions are seen with increasing cylinder numbers. The reverse is the case for combined fuel efficiency.
Premium gasoline is the most common fuel type. This fuel type produce the most CO2 emissions of the five fuel types in the dataset.
There's a positive correlation between combined fuel efficiency and fuel economy score. This relationship is approximately linear. The relationship between CO2 emission and greenhouse gas score is identical in linearity but inverse in magnitude. This results in a strong linear, positive relationship between fuel economy score and greenhouse gas score.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For this presentation, I focused on the relationships between displacement, combined fuel efficiency, CO2 emissions, how they relate with fuel economy scores and greenhouse gas scores, and how they're modified by other variables of interest like cylinders, vehicle class, fuel type, transmission type and manufacturing year. I started by introducing the
variables of interest and plotting their distribution pattern, on histogram plots and bar plots.

Afterwards, I explore the the relationships between the numeric variables using a heatmap grid and replots. I use boxplots to explore the relationships between these numeric variables and the categorical variables of interest and clustered barplots to explore the relationship between the categorical variables. Further scatterplots are plotted to further highlight these observed relationships.
